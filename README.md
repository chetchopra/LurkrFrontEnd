## About
This is the front end for an reddit browsing app. Have you ever wanted to view multiple subreddits at the same time in a grid like view? And have the ability to expand posts from any subreddit without having to switch tabs? This project does just that.

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This front-end links to a ruby on rails backend that I made. You can feel free to clone or fork that repo as well from
